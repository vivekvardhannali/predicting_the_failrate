Failure Rate Predictor
This project predicts student failure rates using historical academic data and machine learning techniques. It aims to identify students at risk of failing, helping institutions intervene early.
Overview
-> Objective: Predict whether a student will pass or fail based on key academic and personal indicators.
-> Methodology: Built a classification model using Random Forest on a publicly available dataset.
-> Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Google Colab.
Datasets
-> Source: The dataset is publicly available and referenced in the code.
-> Features include study habits, family background, previous grades, and more.
-> The target variable is binary: pass or fail.
Features Used
-> Study time
-> Number of past class failures
-> Absences
-> Parental education level
-> Previous grades
-> Other demographic and behavior-based features
Model Details
-> Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier
-> Preprocessing: Handled missing values using fillna(), encoded categorical variables, and performed feature selection.
-> Evaluation: Accuracy score printed at the end of the notebook after training.

Key Highlights
-> Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key patterns.
-> Implemented feature importance visualization to determine top influencing factors.
-> Model is interpretable and computationally efficient.
-> Demonstrated how machine learning can assist educational institutions in academic risk prediction.

Project Outcomes
-> Successfully trained a failure prediction model with meaningful accuracy.
-> Reduced noise through effective preprocessing and feature selection.
-> Illustrated practical application of Random Forest in classification tasks related to education analytics.
